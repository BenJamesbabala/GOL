Installation instructions
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You need a working CUDA installation on your system if you want to use GPU acceleration.
On Ubuntu cuda can be installed using the package manager, for example.

1. Install OpenCV, if it is not installed. 
Follow the instructions on the OpenCV website

2. Install the gol python module
python setup.py install
This will install all the dependencies.
If you run into any problems in this step, try installing the dependencies manually as follows:
    sudo apt-get install pip python-dev
    pip install theano
    pip install nose
    pip install cython
    pip install matplotlib

3. Setup theano for the GPU (Optional)
Create a .theanorc file in your home directory.
Paste the following lines into the file:

[global]
floatX = float32
device = gpu0

[nvcc]
fastmath = True

If you want to try pROST by using the example Program in gol.subspace_tracking.main.py you also have to download the
changedetection.net dataset from www.changedetection.net.
